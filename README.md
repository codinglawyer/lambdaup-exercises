# Exercises

## EX 1

1. Create let binding - try to assign string/int to let binding
2. \*Scope trick
3. Basic type - try to type let binding that was create in the previous step
4. Create a record with several different type string/int/float/bool
5. Create an array with string/int elements (try to show each element in the console)
6. Create a tuple and try to destruct it. Show destructed date inside a console
7. Create a list (try to show each element in the console)
8. Create basic functions that will be do multiplication. Use labeled arguments
9. Use currying from previous functions

## EX 2

1. Create a variant that will contain Yes/No answer type. Try to assign it to let binding
2. Create a constructor variant. Type should hold a few information about conference like Name, Duration and City. Each of variant should contain type constructor e.g. the name should hold a string
3. Create a parameterized type. e.g. zone that can hold three values and two of them are the same. Result this type should be a list(int, int, string) or list(float, float, string)
4. Create optional type with `option` and assign to let binding
5. Patter Matching!
   - Create a variant of knowledge level e.g. `Low`, `Medium` and `High`
   - Create a variant of three prgramming languages that you like
   - Create a functiona which accepts 2 parameters (knowledge and language) and try to match all possieble cases ;)
6. Try to write functions that solve the factorial algorithm (5! = 5\*4\*3\*2\*1 = 120), using recursive and Patter Matching.
